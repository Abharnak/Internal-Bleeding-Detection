This project focuses on detecting internal bleeding using Wireless Capsule Endoscopy images. 
I used MobileNetV2 for its lightweight and efficient architecture, applying transfer learning to leverage pre-trained ImageNet weights. 
The dataset was processed with normalization and augmentation techniques to prevent overfitting. 
The model was fine-tuned and trained using categorical crossentropy and the Adam optimizer. Evaluation was done using accuracy and confusion matrix, with a plan to include precision and recall.


Custom CNN: Typically achieves around 80–88% accuracy on validation data, depending on depth and regularization.

MobileNetV2 (Transfer Learning): Usually outperforms CNN, often reaching 90–95% accuracy, because it uses pretrained weights from ImageNet and generalizes better with fewer training samples.
